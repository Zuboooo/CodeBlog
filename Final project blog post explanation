I decided to create the game "chopsticks" or just "sticks" since it is an extremely nostalgic game for me as I used to play this game at the bus stop every day before elementary school. I recently started playing sticks amongst my friends again and saw this as a good opportunity to create the game in python. Everyone I play with plays the game with mildly variation of the rules so by coding the game it makes everyone play with the same ruleset.

My code uses the "import random" library to chose a random player to go first to keep it fair. Then you are given the choice to either "attack" or "split." Attacking starts off with you selecting the hand you chose to attack with and then you pick which of your opponents hands you attack. This adds the value of your hand to theirs. if this value is greater than or equal to 5 that hand is set to the value of 0. The split option lets you choose which hand you'd like to divide evenly between your 2 hands. The game continues until a player has a value of 0 for both hands. 

The most unique part of my code is the timers. I added the timers as a callback to when me and my friends in elementary school would joke about how long the games were lasting due to us continually "splitting" to stall out the game. At the start and end of the code it gives the date and time. At the end of the code it give the total time in seconds, that the game has lasted. This is done through the use of the libraries "import time" and "from datetime import datetime."
